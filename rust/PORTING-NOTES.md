# Porting Notes

Non-obvious deviations from the Go port forced by Rust semantics. Each entry:
file(s), the Go pattern, the Rust substitution, and why it is behavior-preserving.

Format: `## <date> <rust file> — <Go source>`

## 2026-10-07 rust/Cargo.toml — dependency additions beyond SPEC §5.11
- `serde`/`serde_json`: sanctioned by §5.11 for tsconfig/api; also used as the
  substrate of `tsc-json` (Go's `json` package is a thin facade over
  `encoding/json/v2`, ~100 LOC — not a JSONC parser. The spec's "~800 LOC
  JSONC-ish parser" description is stale; tsconfig quirks live in tsoptions).
- `num-bigint`: Go uses `math/big` in `jsnum` (PseudoBigInt + huge-int parse).
  Rust std has no bigint; num-bigint has matching truncated div/rem semantics.

## 2026-10-07 local `cargo check`/`test` by porting agents — SPEC §9.2
SPEC §9.2 says no builds/tests run on the workstation because the machine has
no toolchain "by design". A toolchain (cargo 1.97.1) is in fact installed and
IDE-resident. Agents use local `cargo test`/`clippy` with isolated
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/tsrs-check-*` purely as an iteration aid. The
authoritative gate remains `remote-test.sh` on dih@192.168.1.15; nothing
local-only counts toward a milestone gate.

## 2026-10-07 crates/collections — OrderedMap JSON marshalling deferred
Go `OrderedMap.MarshalJSONTo`/`UnmarshalJSONFrom` (json.MarshalerTo impls)
deferred behind `// TODO(port)` until `tsc-json` exists; serde
Serialize/Deserialize impls provided in the interim.

## 2026-10-07 SPEC corrections discovered while porting (Go is truth)
- `json/` is a ~100-LOC facade over encoding/json/v2, not a JSONC parser.
- `contentmapper` imports ast/parser/ipc/jsonrpc — cannot be a Layer-1 port;
  deferred until those crates exist (post-M3).
- `symlinks` imports ast/module — deferred likewise.
- `sourcemap` imports scanner — deferred to M3+ (spec said "emit side first";
  the emit path still pulls scanner types).
- `vfs` imports `osutil` — ported as `tsc-osutil` in M1 despite being listed
  in Layer 6.
